  <li><b>Community control.</b> I understand we can use the Common Good System, as a democratic community, to reclaim control of our local economy for the common good. I am willing to participate with other Members to do that, and to support other communities to do the same.</li>
  <li><b>Investing together.</b> I understand whenever I put money in my %PROJECT account, there is more money in the <%aDollar-Pool>Dollar Pool</a>, so my community has more money to invest while I use my %PROJECT credit for purchases.</li>
  <li><b>Backing together.</b> I understand my %PROJECT credit is <%aBacking>backed</a> 100% or more &mdash; partly by money in the Dollar Pool and partly by Members and Member Organizations.</li>
  <li><b>Accepting payments.</b> I will accept %PROJECT credit as payment, <%aWithout-Limit>without limit or surcharge</a>.</li>
  <li><b>Account Balance.</b> If I spend more than the balance in my %PROJECT account, resulting in a negative balance, I will bring my balance up to zero or more within 30 days.</li>
  <li><b>Disputes.</b> When there is a dispute, I will follow the <%aDisputes>%PROJECT Dispute Resolution Process</a> and will honor its outcome.</li>
  <li><b>Changes.</b> I understand I will have the <%aParticipation>opportunity to participate</a> in any decision to change this Agreement, and if I use my account after changes have been approved, that means I agree to those changes.</li>
