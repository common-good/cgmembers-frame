Feature: Tx
AS a member
I WANT to transfer credit to or from another member (acting on their own behalf)
SO I can buy and sell stuff.
 We will eventually need variants or separate feature files for neighbor (member of different community within the region) to member, etc.
 And foreigner (member on a different server) to member, etc.

Setup:
  Given members:
  | uid  | fullName | address | city  | state  | zip | country  | postalAddr | floor | flags      |*
  | .ZZA | Abe One  | 1 A St. | Atown | Alaska | 01000 | US     | 1 A, A, AK |  -250 | ok,confirmed,debt         |
  | .ZZB | Bea Two  | 2 B St. | Btown | Utah   | 02000 | US     | 2 B, B, UT |     0 | ok,confirmed         |
  | .ZZC | Our Pub  | 3 C St. | Ctown | Cher   |       | France | 3 C, C, FR |     0 | ok,confirmed,co      |
  And these "u_relations":
  | main | agent | permission |*
  | .ZZA | .ZZB  | buy        |
  | .ZZB | .ZZA  | read       |
  | .ZZC | .ZZB  | buy        |

  | uid  | balance |*
  | .ZZA |       0 |
  | .ZZB |       0 |
  | .ZZC |       0 |

# (rightly fails, so do this in a separate feature) Variants: with/without an agent
#  | ".ZZA" | # member to member (pro se) |
#  | ".ZZA" | # agent to member           |
