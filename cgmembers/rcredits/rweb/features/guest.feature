AS a member company or administrator
I WANT to track payments from non-members
SO I can accept credit card payments without having to have our own credit card processing deal.

Setup:
  Given members:
  | uid  | fullName | phone        | address | city  | state  | zip | country  | postalAddr | floor | flags              | coFlags   | emailCode |*
  | .ZZA | Abe One  | +13013013001 | 1 A St. | Atown | Alaska | 01000 | US     | 1 A, A, AK |  -250 | ok,confirmed,debt  |           |           |
  | .ZZB | Bea Two  |              | 2 B St. | Btown | Utah   | 02000 | US     | 2 B, B, UT |  -250 | ok,confirmed,debt  |           |           |
  | .ZZC | Our Pub  | +13333333333 | 3 C St. | Ctown | Cher   |       | France | 3 C, C, FR |     0 | ok,confirmed,co    |           | Cc3       |
  And members have:
  | uid  | emailCode |*
  | cgf  | CgF       |
  And these "u_relations":
  | main | agent | permission |*
  | .ZZA | .ZZB  | buy        |
  | .ZZB | .ZZA  | read       |
  | .ZZC | .ZZB  | buy        |
  | .ZZC | .ZZA  | manage     |
  Then balances:
  | uid  | balance |*
  | .ZZA |       0 |
  | .ZZB |       0 |
  | .ZZC |       0 |

Scenario: A non-member pays a member company by credit card
  Given button code "buttonCode" for:

Skip Don't allow ACH for guests (for regulatory reasons: the bank wants us to KYC)
# This includes donations to member organizations we don't sponsor, because we don't trust the member organization like we do ourselves.
