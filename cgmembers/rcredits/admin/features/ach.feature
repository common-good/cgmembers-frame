Feature: Checks and Deposits
AS an administrator
I WANT to print checks from members to rCredits
SO we can accept their US Dollars in exchange for rCredits

AND I WANT to print checks from rCredits to members
So we can accommodate members' requests to cash out

AND I WANT to display deposit statements and individual checks for current and past deposits
SO I can make deposits easily and review past deposits as necessary

Setup:
  Given members:
