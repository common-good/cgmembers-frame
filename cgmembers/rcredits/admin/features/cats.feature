Feature: Categories (cats)
AS an administrator
I WANT to categorize transactions and export them to QuickBooks
SO we save a lot of time on bookkeeping

Setup:
  Given members:
  | uid  | fullName | floor | flags              |*
  | .ZZA | Abe One  |  -250 | ok,confirmed,admin |
  | .ZZB | Bea Two  |  -250 | ok,confirmed,debt  |
  | .ZZC | Our Pub  |     0 | ok,confirmed,co    |
  | .ZZF | Fox Co   |     0 | ok,confirmed,co    |
  And these "admins":
  | uid  | vKeyE     | can                 |*
  | .ZZA | DEV_VKEYE | v,panel,editTx,code |
  And these "people":
  | pid | fullName |*
  | 101 | Yoyo Yot |
  | 102 | Zeta Zot |
  And member ".ZZC" is sponsored
  And these "tx_rules":
  | id        | 1            |**
  | payer     |              |
  | payerType | %REF_ANYBODY |
  | payee     | .ZZC         |
  | payeeType | %REF_ACCOUNT |
  | from      | %MATCH_PAYEE |
  | to        | cgf          |
  | action    | %ACT_SURTX   |
  | amount    | 0            |
  | portion   | .05          |
  | purpose   | sponsor      |
  | minimum   | 0            |
  | useMax    |              |
  | amtMax    |              |
  | template  |              |
  | start     | %now         |
  | end       |              |
  | code      |              |

Scenario: admin visits the Set Categories page
  When member ".ZZA" visits page "sadmin/set-cats"
  Then we show "Set Transaction Categories" with:
  | Starting Date | 202 | -01 |
  | Set Cats      | | |

Scenario: admin sets most categories and sends to QBO
  Given these "txs":
  | eid | xid | created | amount | payer      | payee | purpose | rule | type  | recursId | flags   |*
