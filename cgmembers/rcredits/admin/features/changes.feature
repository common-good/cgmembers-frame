Scenario: A member changes some settings
  Given member ".ZZA" completes form "settings/preferences" with values:
  | roundup | statements | secretBal |*
  |       0 | paper      |         0 |
  And member ".ZZA" has done step "fund"
  And member ".ZZA" completes form "settings/fund" with values:
  | connect | routingNumber | bankAccount | bankAccount2 | cashout | refills | target | achMin | saveWeekly |*
  |       1 |     211870281 |         123 |          123 |       0 |       1 |    100 |     11 |          0 |
  When member ".ZZD" visits page "sadmin/changes/qid=NEWZZA"
  Then we show "Account Changes for Abe One" with:
  | %mdY | flags       | ok ided       | ok ided              | abeone     |
  And with:

  | %mdY | achMin      |            10 |                   11 | abeone     |
  And with:
  | %mdY | bankAccount |               | (secret)             | abeone     |
# sometimes this happens out of order (dunno why)

#  | %mdY | bankAccount |                      | USkk211870281123            | abeone     | (this will work with member "D:1" when decry('V') works)
