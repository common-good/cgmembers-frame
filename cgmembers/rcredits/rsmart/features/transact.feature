Feature: Transact
AS a company agent
I WANT to transfer rCredits to or from another member
SO my company can sell stuff, give refunds, and trade rCredits for US Dollars.

# We will eventually need variants or separate feature files for neighbor (member of different community within the region) to member, etc. and foreigner (member on a different server) to member, etc.
# cc means cardCode
